This repository contains R code for the paper

'A simulation tool to scrutinise the behaviour of functional diversity metrics'

by Jana M. McPherson, Lauren A. Yeager, and Julia K. Baum

currently under review by Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 


The purpose of sharing the code here on GitHub is to make it available in executable format. The same code is available in pdf format as an appendix to the paper.

The GitHub site will automatically display the latest version of the code should there be any updates. You can download the code from GitHub by clicking the 'Clone or Download' button (near the top on the right). If you are familiar with GitHub, you can also fork and adapt the code if you wish.

If you encounter any problems in using the code please email me, and I will do my best to resolve the issue. 

Best wishes,

Jana McPherson
